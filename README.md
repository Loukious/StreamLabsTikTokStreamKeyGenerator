## FAQ
### I'm getting you `You can't open the application "***" because it may be damaged or incomplete` error on MacOS. What should I do?
I don't own a Mac so I can't test the app on MacOS but you can try the following:
1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the following command: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/the/StreamLabsTikTokStreamKeyGenerator.app` (replace `/path/to/the/StreamLabsTikTokStreamKeyGenerator.app` with the path to the app).
3. Try to run the app again.

### I'm getting a `Maximum number of attempts reached. Try again later.` error. What should I do?
This error sometimes occurs when TikTok detects selenium. You can use this [extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/export-cookie-json-file-f/nmckokihipjgplolmcmjakknndddifde) to export your cookies and import them into the script.
1. Start by installing the above extension in your browser.
2. Log into TikTok in the browser (if not already logged in), then export the cookies using the extension (while being on TikTok's website). 
3. After that, place the file in the same directory as the script and rename it to `cookies.json` then start the app.
### Do I need to have 1k followers to get Streamlabs TikTok LIVE access?
No, you can request access even if you have less than 1k followers.
